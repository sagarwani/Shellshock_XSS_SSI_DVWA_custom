Do you enjoy finding bugs? If yes, follow the below steps to setup up your buggy machine:

1. Untar the tar.gz file in DVWA machine and copy the "spc" folder to the dvwa/vulnerabilities path.
2. Navigate to the spc folder and check for the file setup.sh. It must have executable permissions.
3. Run the sudo ./setup.sh.
4. Check if the installation is successful without errors. Report bugs to pv,sw.
5. Check if you are able to browse low, medium and high spc custom pages.

Troubleshoot
------------

-> For any failures, do check the permissions and complete system path's of the files/folders involved.
-> If the apache server goes down, restore from apache2.conf.backup created by setup.sh
